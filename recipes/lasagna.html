                    bread crumbs, salt, and ground black pepper in a separate shallow dish.</li>
                <li>Dip eggplant slices into egg mixture, then press each gently into bread crumb mixture.</br>
                    Gently tap off any excess crumbs. Arrange slices on the prepared baking
                </li>

                    about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir tomato sauce into ground beef; bring to a simmer and set </br>
